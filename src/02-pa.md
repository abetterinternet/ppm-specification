This section specifies a framework for generic PA protocols. Concrete
instantiations of this framework are described in [Section 3](prio.md) and
[Section 4](hits.md).

[TODO: Say that protocol messages are carried by HTTP requests and responses.]

[TODO: Decide how to authenticate the leader in leader-to-helper connections.
One option is to use client certificates for TLS; another is to have the leader
sign its messages directly, as in Prio v2.]

[TODO: Decide the "content type" for HTTP requests.]

[TODO: chris-wood suggested we specify APIs for producing and consuming each of
the messages in the protocol. Specific PA protocols would implement this API.]

**Error handling.**
In this section, we will use the verbs "abort" and "alert with `[some error
message]`" to describe how protocol participants react to various error
conditions. The behavior is specified in [the "Alerts" section](pa-error.md) For
common errors, we may elide the description of the behavior altogether and refer
to to that section.
