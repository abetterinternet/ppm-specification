# NOTES FOR AUTHORS

To create a link to a section, do

```
[displayed text](name-of-file.md)
```

Example: [link](overview.md)

You can create a link to a subsection using

```
[displayed text](name-of-file.md#title-of-subsection)
```

Example: [link](overview.md#hits)

[NOTE(cjpatton): I'm not sure if there's a way to have it generate the section
number.]
